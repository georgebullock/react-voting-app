# REACT VOTING APP

### OVERVIEW

React Voting App is a small project that I completed to practice test-driven development with React. The project was inspired by a code challenge I encountered while reading Full-Stack React.

### PROJECT STACK

- HTML5
- CSS3 via SCSS
- ES6+ via Babel
- Module Bundling via Webpack
- Live Reload via Webpack Dev Server
- Formatting via Prettier
- Linting via ESLint
- Type Checking via Flow
- Unit Testing via Jest and React Testing Library

> ⚠️ Warning: The project uses husky and lint-staged to prevent you from
> committing code that doesn't pass validation (i.e. formatting, linting, and
> type checking).

### SETUP INSTRUCTIONS 👇

```bash
git clone git@github.com:georgebullock/react-voting-app.git

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

#### Project Motivation:
In early 2020, I resigned from my first coding job and began systematically leveling my frontend skills. My focus was on React and testing. My aim was to get a job working full time on an SPA. 

I needed a project that I could build quickly using the React I already knew and focus the majority of my time on applying what I was learning about testing.

#### Project Status:
This project is complete.

#### Project Roadmap:
No additonal features are planned.

#### Known Issues:
There are no known technical issues. If you find something, feel free to let me know, or send me a pull request.
